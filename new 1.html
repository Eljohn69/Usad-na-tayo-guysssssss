	 <p> I Still Love You
	 <hr>
	 <p> Hi Rhezyl, I know it's already been just a day, but I can't stop thinking about you. I miss your presence, I miss our conversations with each other. I know it's hard to move on when you love that person. So, I am going to go straight to the point. Can we start again?. I know it is hard, but I still love you so much that I can't even sleep properly without thinking about you. As I was reflecting on what just happened, I realized that this is not over. I realized that this was just a phase, a challenge to our relationship. I know that this is just a problem that we failed to talk about. I know that maybe it's part of our relationship to lose sparks. But Love doesn't rely on Sparks, it relies on the people involved in it. Even if it means starting back to 0, maybe we can just talk about it and have a deep conversation. If you would just give me one more chance to redeem myself, please let me do redeem myself. I promise to be a better listener, friend, and partner who can suit your needs, I know that by communicating and talking our hearts out, we can figure this out and make the foundation of our relationship stronger. I know it's hard for you, and I respect your feelings and opinions, but I'm just not ready to let you go. I'm not ready to let someone important to me go. because you're everything I wished for, i admired everything that you do. I admire you truly to the point that I would flex you to my friends. I know loving me isn't easy, but I know that you tried your best. And I am forever grateful for it. But I feel like I can't just help it, but I want to be with you again. I would rather argue a lot with you than let you go. I know your feelings have already changed, but can we try again? Even if you don't feel the same, let's just give it a try. If your feelings are already settled, then what can I do? 

         After we stopped chatting, I felt helpless and miserable, a stupid guy who failed to give you enough attention, love, etc. As I was re-reading our chat, I realized that I was the one who failed to show enough love for not being able to update and say 'I love you' before going to sleep. However, I regretted it all, to the point that it still haunts me today. there is no second that I don't think of you. I always think about what you're up to and if you're okay. whenever I think you, I always say to myself, "Basin ako ray nagkulang ug love niya" " As I am writing this, I feel mixed emotions, feeling happy because I'm typing my heart out, feeling sad because I let you go, feeling idk what ts is but. I regretted it all. maybe I should have talked to you at school, but I didn't. maybe because I'm shy or maybe because I'm afraid that I don't know what to speak next, which is the problem I commonly face or deal with HAHAHAHAH.

         Every time I think of us, it looks like a tulip. at the peak of our relationship, it blooms, and we adore it, but over time, we start giving it less and less attention, just like what happened to us. if it's about to die, this is where the memories start to flashback. but as one dies. another one grows and this is a opportunity to start a again. Is it never too late to start again? One of my biggest regrets is not appreciating you enough. I took your presence in my life for granted, assuming that our connection was unbreakable. I didn't always express my love and gratitude, and I often prioritized my own needs over yours. I now understand that relationships require constant reassurance, and that is what's keeping our relationship alive

         I realized that maybe I was too selfish. making my opinions more vulnerable, but to have a good relationship, I realized that both of our opinions need to be valued. I also realize that I wasn't always a good communicator. I often ignoring your feelings, avoided difficult conversations, and hoped that problems would simply disappear. I now understand that opening up is essential for a healthy relationship. I need to be better at expressing my emotions, listening to your concerns, and working together to resolve problems.

         I know that I can't promise you a perfect relationship. There will always be challenges, disagreements, and moments of frustration. But I can promise you that I will always be honest with you, that I will always prioritize your needs, and that I will always strive to be the best partner I can be. I will listen to you, support you, and cherish you every single day. because that is what partners are for. being present when we are facing challenges or when you need some support, just know that I'm always here supporting you wholeheartedly.

         I understand that you may need time to process this, to consider my words, and to decide what you want to do. I respect your decision, whatever it may be. I am not trying to pressure you or manipulate you in any way. I simply wanted to express my feelings and to let you know that I am still here, waiting for you, if you are willing to give us another chance. I believe that what we had was special, something worth fighting for. I know that we made mistakes, but I also believe that we are capable of learning from them and creating a relationship that is even stronger and more fulfilling than before. I am willing to put in the work, make the necessary changes, and prove to you that I am worthy of your love.

         I've been working on myself, understanding where I fell short, and learning how to be a better partner. I miss everything about you, your smile, our conversations, the way we laugh together. I know itâ€™s hard to start again, but I'm willing to put in the effort. I want to be patient, listen to your concerns, and show you that I can be the person you deserve.  I've reread our convos a couple of times already, trying to understand where things went wrong. I've observed my actions and behaviors, figuring out for the moments where I could have done better. It hasn't been an easy process, but it's been necessary. 

         I've been thinking a lot lately, deciding whether I should make this or not. I just can't get rid of you in my mind. I believe that every problem has a solution so maybe this has a solution. Whenever you're online, I always hope that you will message me. its just that I missed you a lot already. If you're not ready to start again, just know that I will be waiting for you, whether it takes a year
